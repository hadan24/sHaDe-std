# sHaDe-std

My attempt at reimplementing several basic data structures and standard library
structures in C++! The goals are to:
* reacquaint myself with C++,
* understand these standard concepts at a deeper level,
* learn about their implementations and alternative approaches,
* use this as an outlet to read about and test optimization techniques.

This code is not meant to be used by others and will not be maintained with
that in mind.
